      Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a former chemical & materials engineer turned junior software developer who recently graduated from <a
        href="https://devacademy.co.nz/" alt="Enspiral Dev Academy">Enspiral Dev Academy</a>. I decided to shift careers
      into tech because I see lots of opportunities for values-aligned work in the industry, particularly around green
      tech, DEI, and community-building.
    </p>
    <p>
      My skills are in React.JS, node backend, and SQL, but I'm quick to learn and am eager to explore other frameworks.
      From previous education, work and volunteer experience, I am also comfortable with data analysis, client &
      stakeholder management, and teaching & working with young people. My hobbies include rock climbing, running,
      cycling, reading, crochet/knitting, watching movies featuring Viggo Mortensen, cooking, and the strategy board
      game Go.
    </p>
    <p>I am a New Zealand & European citizen, open to work anywhere in NZ & AU.</p>

      <i>Front-end development with React.JS</i><br>
      I've always really liked games with simple rules with the possibility for great complexity. I thought this would
      be a good way to try out my React skills in a fun domain.

      Submissions on public policy made easy. This was our final group project for the Enspiral Dev Academy bootcamp. We
      aim to make it easier for the general public to have their say on public consultations, through easier sharing of
      templates for submissions.
