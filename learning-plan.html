                    I'm not too sure about this, and think I will need constant revisiting. I realise that value aligned work is very important to me, but also that this might not be feasible in the short term, and picking up skills quicker might be the best approach for my earlier working experience. I love working with and getting the most out of people, so perhaps I could work in something of that vein. I have this idea in my head that I am not synical enough to be an effective manager, but I want to believe that is not true in a more progressive tech environment.

                    Description of my own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I believe I am a good natural learner. I genuinely enjoy it in most cases, and spend a lot of my free time learning for the sake of learning. I learn best in a hands on and practical environment. 
                    I learn worst through listening. 
                    My biggest weakness in learning is that I am easily distracted, and am not especially motivated when working by myself. 
                    Another weakness of mine is my poor organisational skills.
                    My best learning environment is a collaborative and hands on environment. I am especially excited for the bootcamp, and believe this will be both lots of fun and a great learning environment for me.

                <p>
                    All of the skills! I think at this stage, I don't know what I don't know or what I most enjoy. I am just enjoying the broad learning.

                    <p>

                    Support, coaching, mentoring. Everything they have done has been great. I'm writing this in week 8, and they have been fantastic.
