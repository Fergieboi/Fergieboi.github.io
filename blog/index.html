What is my site's primary purpose?

Who is my audience? (is it kids, adults, academics)?

How will I build my site to support their user experience?

Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!

What other directories do I need (e.g images)? Where do I put that directory?

Do I want the style to be applied to your blog entries also?
