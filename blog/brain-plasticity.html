            Neural Plasticity

            How cool is neural plasticity. I really enjoyed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ngs5_WXxfo&ab_channel=ProfCarlin%27sYoutubePage"> introductory video</a> which Dev Academy recommended.

            I do realise that I still subscribe to a fixed mindset about learning languages. I still drift into a fixed mindset that I am bad at learning languages, and while I do try to learn, I don't have high expectations. Watching the video, and reading more in this foundations course has reminded me to challenge these fixed mindset ideas.
